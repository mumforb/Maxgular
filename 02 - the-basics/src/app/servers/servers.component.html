<p>check it. so, the square brackets means we're using property binding. an expression goes in the quotation marks. this is also kind of a different way to use the same switch: {{ allowNewServer }}. the thing that goes in quotation marks following a bound property is a typescript expression.</p>
<p [innerText]="allowNewServer">This too!</p>
